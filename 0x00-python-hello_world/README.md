# Welcome to the Python World!

Welcome to my repository! In this project, you will dive into the Python world and explore its fundamentals. Whether you are new to programming or already familiar with other languages, this project aims to introduce you to Python's simplicity and versatility.

## Author's Disclaimer

The initial projects lean towards a more "C-oriented" approach, focusing on simplicity without complex syntax. As you progress, you'll discover the multitude of ways Python allows you to accomplish tasks. Just like C has its style guide, Python follows PEP8 (PyCode), ensuring consistent and readable code.

Enjoy the journey!
